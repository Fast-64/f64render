# f64render

f64render is an addon adding a Render Engine for [Fast64](https://github.com/Fast-64/fast64)'s F3D materials.

It for now performs on par with the EEVEE-nodes-based rendering present in Fast64, but without the stutters due to EEVEE shaders compilation.

It also offers increased accuracy, with for example blender cycles emulation which is not possible with EEVEE.

It is currently in development but very usable already!
